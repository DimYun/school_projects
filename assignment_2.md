##Task 2  
  
1. **Purpose** is to write a program in python 2 for searching and reporting information.   
That allow you build a organize system for reporting main approaches in the sciences.
  
2. **Objectives** is:
    + choice branch of science (biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and   
    anything else in your own convenience)
    + formation theoretical framework for the program
        + definition of science
        + the basic relationship between the objects of study, for example:   
        *Chemistry: matter - a group of molecules - groups of atoms - elements*
    + point where is most often used modeling in the selected science:   
    *Chemistry - simulation of the interaction of molecules;*  
    *Physics - simulation of the interaction of atoms*
    + describe the main directions of science (2 or 3 on choosing):   
    *Chemistry - quantum calculations, production control, the synthesis of drugs*  
/  
3. **Software implementation** of program output realize in the console   
application form or use grafical user interface (GUI). If you choose GUI - use PyQt 4   
(there are articles on habrahabr.ru, or read downloaded book). You can use Qt Desiger   
for quick layout interface (but better to start by writing youself)
  
4. **At the output** you must download file (or files) with the code to you github   
repository and **get a cookie**, if you do everything =)

5. **Summary** You programes should look like:  
    + *'Input name of science: ' -> print all information*  
    *'Would you like to add some iformation? Yes/No/Bye' -> user must print yes, no*  
    *or bye to exit*   
    *if yes - specify what kinde of information you want add, etc.*  
    *after specify, user print new information and press enter*
    *programm show all information about science*
    *'Would you like to add some iformation? Yes/No/Bye'*

##Notes  

* You must write all in English language (cose there will be some problems with   
encodings in you programm). If you success, you can try to move the program  
into Russian (encoding cp1251, for Windows). 
* Use simple shapes for GUI, to create an interface (such as: label, PushButton,  
TextEdit, Horizontal layout and Vertical layout)
* If you have questions - google it in English, pay attention to the site sourceforge.   
Or ask me.
* Have a nice days with it =)
